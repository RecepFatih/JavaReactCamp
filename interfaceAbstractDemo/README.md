### Objectives of the project; <br/>

- It will be created for Starbucks and Nero firm.
- Both companies want to register their customers in the database.
- Starbucks wants to perform e-government verification when registering its customers in its database.
Nero doesn't want to. (The e-government system is an application used in Turkey. We can verify with name, surname, national identity and year of birth.)
